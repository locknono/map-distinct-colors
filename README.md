#  Map Distinct Colors ![GitHub license](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue.svg)

Determine which color should be applied to which cluster according to the position and size of clusters.

This helps make a more visually differentiated clustring result.









## Motivation

Assuming that there are  `n`  clusters with position infomation and  `n`  categorical colors,the color scheme has  `n!`  possibilities.

When  `n`  grows bigger and distance between clusters differs widely,some of the color schemes reduce the distinction between clusters.

So what is the best color scheme which can reduce visual confusion and clearly differentiate clusters?
